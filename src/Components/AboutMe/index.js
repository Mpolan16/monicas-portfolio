              I am a Full-Stack Web Developer with a BA from the College of the Holy Cross. I recently graduated from UNC Chapel Hill with a certificate in Web Development and developed skills in JavaScript, HTML, CSS, jQuery, Web APIs, Node.js, MySQL, Mongo, React.js, Bootstrap, Git, Express, and Jest, to develop MERN apps serving a variety of platforms. Most recently, I worked with a team of four to develop The Tutor Tracker, a student management system web application designed for educators to organize one on one meetings with their students on an interactive calendar. Known as a team player who is passionate about creating innovative web apps, I am excited to apply what Iâ€™ve learned to new opportunities in web development. I love hanging out with my cat, eating spicy food, and learning new languages. I am open to remote opportunites.
